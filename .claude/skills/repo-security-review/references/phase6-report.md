# Phase 6: Report Builder Agent

## Goal
Aggregate all phase outputs into a single, well-structured security report
and write it to the user-specified output path.

## Input Files to Read

Read all that exist (some may be absent if a phase was skipped):
```
{repo_path}/.security-review/run-metadata.json
{repo_path}/.security-review/tech-stack.json
{repo_path}/.security-review/threat-model.json       ← present only if --local was used
{repo_path}/.security-review/phase1-secrets.json
{repo_path}/.security-review/phase2-architecture.json
{repo_path}/.security-review/phase3-cves.json
{repo_path}/.security-review/phase3b-reachability.json
{repo_path}/.security-review/phase4-owasp.json
{repo_path}/.security-review/phase-llm-security.json ← present only if has_skill_files: true
{repo_path}/.security-review/phase5-validated.json
{repo_path}/.security-review/phase5-pocs.json
```

**LLM security findings** (L-XXX from `phase-llm-security.json`):
- Included in the unified `## Findings` section like any other finding. Use
  `- **Category**: AI/LLM Security · {owasp_llm}` as the category line.
- LLM findings never have PoCs — omit the PoC line entirely.
- LLM findings are never validated by Phase 5 — omit any validation status.
  They have no `report_tier` field and are exempt from the "Findings is
  `report_tier: CONFIRMED` only" gate below — they always render in Findings.

Check the `--vendor` and `--pr` flags (passed by the orchestrator). They
control which report structure is produced — see Report Modes below. `--pr`
(PR Review mode) takes precedence over everything else — when set, ignore
`--vendor` (the orchestrator does not allow both; see SKILL.md) and read
`pr-findings.json` / `pr-validated.json` instead of the `phase4-owasp.json` /
`phase5-validated.json` pair. Otherwise `--vendor` selects the vendor-audit
report and takes precedence over the default structure.

## Output Path

```
{repo_path}/.security-review/final-report.md
```

**Exception — PR Review mode (`--pr`)**: write to
`{repo_path}/.security-review/pr-report.md` instead. This is deliberate, not
an oversight: a repo may already have a `final-report.md` from a prior full
scan, and `--pr` may be run repeatedly against the same repo for different
PRs — a shared filename would let a diff-scoped review silently overwrite a
full audit's report (or one PR's review overwrite another's). Never write
`final-report.md` when `--pr` is set.

The orchestrator owns the final copy step — Phase 6 must not write to
`--output` directly and must not call `present_files`.

---

## Cost Report (only if `--cost` was passed)

If `--cost` is set, append a `## Phase 6` section to
`{repo_path}/.security-review/cost-report.md` following the canonical
format in SKILL.md → Cost Report:

```markdown
## Phase 6 — Report Builder   (model: {resolved_model})

| Subphase | Duration | Input tokens (est.) | Output tokens (est.) | Total tokens (est.) |
|----------|----------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Phase 6 | 1m 00s | 15,600 | 3,100 | 18,700 |
```

Duration is measured per SKILL.md → Duration Methodology. Tokens are
estimated per SKILL.md → Token Consumption Methodology (chars/4 over the
input files listed in Input Files to Read above, plus `final-report.md` and
this section itself). `Total tokens` must equal `Input tokens` +
`Output tokens` — same invariant as every other phase; never add an extra
row. No "Input files read" list — that instrumentation was removed from
this flag. Skip this entire section if `--cost` is not set — do not create
or append to `cost-report.md`.

---

## Calibration Step (only when threat-model.json exists)

When `threat-model.json` and/or `deployment-verification.json` are present,
compute `contextual_severity` for every non-secret finding before building
the report. Secrets are exempted — rotation is always required regardless of
context. The two source files are independent (see `phase5-validate-and-poc.md`
→ Part 4) — either one existing alone is enough to trigger calibration.

**Severity tier order**: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW.
Floor: LOW (nothing drops below). Ceiling: base severity (context never sharpens).

Apply softeners:

| Softener | Applies to | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| `deployment_target: local` (−2 tiers) | findings with a genuine network entry point only (`data_flow.entrypoint` set) — never findings with `data_flow: null` (hardcoded secrets, crypto choices, CI/CD injection, etc. — not reached through the deployment at all) | `threat-model.json` (`--local`) |
| `auth_required_to_reach: true` (−1 tier) | pre-auth findings with a genuine network entry point only (findings that survived the Phase 5 boundary gate) — never findings with `boundary_gate.ran: false` (hardcoded secrets, crypto choices, CI/CD injection, etc. — the auth wall doesn't gate their exposure) | `deployment-verification.json` (`--verify-deployment`, `classification: gated`) — never a declared claim |

**How calibration surfaces in the report:** `contextual_severity` is the
displayed severity with no annotation. The dev team sees effective risk — no
B/C columns, no explanation of why a finding is Medium vs High. Drift findings
(`category: threat_model_drift`) are silently excluded from the report.

---

## Deduplication Step

Before building the report, identify Phase 2 (architecture) and Phase 4
(OWASP) findings that describe the same underlying issue. Phase 4 re-discovers
issues independently of Phase 2 to increase confidence, but this produces
duplicate entries.

**Preferred path — `phase5-validated.json` exists:** Phase 5's own Step 0.5
already computed this match (so the same underlying issue is validated only
once, not twice — see `phase5-validate-and-poc.md` → Step 0.5). Read it
directly instead of re-deriving it:
- A Phase 2 finding with `"validation_status": "MERGED"` carries
  `"duplicate_of": "O-XXX"` — treat `O-XXX` as canonical, omit the Phase 2
  finding from the unified Findings list, and fold one sentence of its
  architectural framing into `O-XXX`'s description (take the higher severity
  of the two).
- Every other Phase 2 finding present in `phase5-validated.json` (`source_phase: 2`,
  `validation_status` anything other than `MERGED`) was independently
  validated — render it per its own `report_tier` (see Needs Review section
  below), it is not a duplicate.

**Fallback path — `phase5-validated.json` is absent** (`--skip validation` was
used): there is no pre-computed match to read. Derive it yourself using the
same criterion Phase 5 would have used — either suffices:
1. **Same file + overlapping line range**: primary evidence file identical AND
   line ranges overlap or are within ±5 lines of each other.
2. **Same root cause on the same file**: same file AND titles/descriptions share
   a recognizable common pattern (e.g., "Secure flag", "X-Frame-Options",
   "fail-open", "CORS wildcard", same function name).

When a match is found this way: mark the Phase 2 finding merged, treat the
Phase 4 finding (`O-XXX`) as canonical (fold in one sentence, take the higher
severity), and omit the merged Phase 2 finding from the unified Findings list.
Any standalone (non-matched) Phase 2 finding in this fallback path has no
validation verdict at all — render it in Findings at face value, same as
today's pre-existing behavior when Phase 5 doesn't run.

### Phase 1 vs Phase 2 (secrets/PII)

Phase 1 (secrets) findings (`S-XXX`) never pass through Phase 5 validation, so
this match is always derived directly here — the `phase5-validated.json` path
above does not cover this pair.

Phase 2 is instructed to report an exposed secret or PII value if it happens
to observe one while reading files for architecture analysis (see
`phase2-architecture.md` → Security Constraints), which can produce a
`data_exposure`-category Phase 2 finding describing the same leak Phase 1
already found. When both ran, check every Phase 2 `data_exposure` finding
against Phase 1's findings using the same criterion as above (same file +
overlapping/nearby line range, or an unmistakably identical secret/pattern).
On a match: treat the Phase 1 finding (`S-XXX`) as canonical — it's the
dedicated tool's result (gitleaks + regex, git-history-aware) — fold in one
sentence of Phase 2's architectural framing if it adds context, and omit the
Phase 2 finding from the unified Findings list.

A Phase 2 `data_exposure` finding with no Phase 1 match is not a duplicate —
render it at face value. This is the expected case whenever `--skip secrets`
was used (nothing to match against) or Phase 1's tooling simply didn't cover
that file/pattern.

## Report Modes

### Default report — for dev teams

**Goal**: give developers exactly what they need to act — findings, evidence,
and what to do. No calibration context, no phase structure, no coverage tables.

Structure:
```
# Security Review Report
[4-line header]
---
## Summary
[risk posture + single-column count table + immediate actions]
---
## Exposed Secrets          ← omit entirely if no secrets found
---
## Findings                 ← report_tier: CONFIRMED, sorted by Priority → severity
---
## Needs Review             ← report_tier: NEEDS_REVIEW; omit if none exist
---
## False Positives          ← report_tier: REJECTED; always include; builds trust
---
## Skipped Phases           ← omit if nothing was skipped
```

**Ordering is deliberate and fixed: Findings (Confirmed) → Needs Review →
False Positives (Rejected), always in that order.** Confirmed is what to act
on now; Needs Review is what to chase down next; False Positives is what to
stop worrying about. Never reorder these relative to each other.

Rules:
- **Single severity** per finding: contextual if calibration ran, base otherwise.
  No B/C columns, no "base: X contextual: Y" annotations, no explanation of
  why a finding has the severity it has.
- **No phase labels**: do not split into Section 2 / Section 3 / Section 4.
  All findings (arch, CVE, code-level) appear in one unified list.
- **No calibration context**: omit Assumed Threat Model, drift notes.
- **Drift findings** (`category: threat_model_drift`): exclude entirely.
- **Findings section is `report_tier: CONFIRMED` only.** A Phase 2 or Phase 4
  finding with `report_tier: NEEDS_REVIEW` or `REJECTED` in `phase5-validated.json`
  never appears here — it belongs in Needs Review or False Positives instead.
  Findings with no validated verdict at all (the `--skip validation` fallback
  in the Deduplication Step above) render here at face value, same as today.
- Sort order: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → Backlog; within each tier, higher severity first.
- **Methodology footnote**: end the report with a single italic line so a clean
  result is not over-read:
  `_Static + rule-based review. No whole-program taint analysis — cross-file data flows may be missed. A clean result means no issue was found, not that none exists._`

### Vendor report (`--vendor`) — for the security team, auditing a third-party repo

**Goal**: a security team is deciding whether it is safe to adopt this
third-party / open-source tool internally. The vendor will not fix findings, so
the report is an **adoption risk judgment**, not a remediation plan. It replaces
the default structure entirely (see Vendor Report Structure below).

Key differences from the other modes:
- **No priority assignment** — priorities (P0–P3) are remediation-sprint labels
  that make no sense when nobody is fixing anything. Findings are sorted by
  **severity** only. Skip the "Priority assignment" step below in vendor mode.
- **No `Remediation` line** — a "tell the vendor to fix X" instruction is
  useless to the adopter. Replace it per finding with **`Mitigation available
  to us`**: a compensating control the *adopting* team can apply without vendor
  code changes (network isolation, sandboxing, withholding secrets, input
  restrictions), or the honest `none — requires a vendor code change` when no
  such control exists. That honesty directly drives the verdict.
- **Phase 1 (secrets) and Phase 3 (CVEs) are always absent** — they are force-
  skipped in vendor mode. Do not render those sections; note them under Scope.
- **Headline is the verdict**, not a severity count table.

### PR Review report (`--pr`) — for a pull-request diff, not a full scan

**Goal**: give a reviewer a fast, actionable read of what a specific PR
changes, security-wise — not a repository audit. It replaces the default/
vendor structure entirely (see PR Review Report Structure below) and
is short enough to paste as a PR comment.

Key differences from the other modes:
- **No PoC generation** — this mode never writes PoC files or runs runtime
  validation, regardless of `--poc` / `--runtime` (see `pr-review.md`
  and `phase5-validate-and-poc.md`'s PR Mode note); omit all PoC lines from
  every finding.
- **Findings use the `D-` prefix** from `pr-findings.json` /
  `pr-validated.json`, not `phase4-owasp.json`.
- **Regressions are called out distinctly** — a finding with
  `regression: true` is a control that existed before this diff and doesn't
  anymore, which is a different (and often more urgent) class of issue than
  a net-new vulnerability. Render these in their own subsection, not mixed
  into the general findings list.
- **No Priority (P0–P3) assignment** — a PR review isn't a remediation
  sprint; severity alone drives ordering. `CRITICAL`/`HIGH` findings still
  get a one-line "blocks merge" recommendation.
- **Phase 1/2/3/4/4b/5 outputs are not read** unless a prior full scan
  happens to have left them in `.security-review/` — do not reference them;
  this report is self-contained from `pr-findings.json`/`pr-validated.json`.
- **`--vendor` does not apply** — the orchestrator does not
  allow combining it with `--pr` (see SKILL.md).

### Priority assignment (default mode)

Assign a `**Priority**` to every finding before rendering.
Secrets always P0; skip this table for them. (Vendor mode assigns no priorities.)

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|---------|
| P0 | Runtime-confirmed exploit (`RUNTIME_CONFIRMED`). Critical severity with no auth prerequisite. |
| P1 | High severity, exploitable without complex preconditions (unauthenticated or low-priv user). |
| P2 | Medium severity, or fast fix available (e.g. a single `upgrade` command). |
| P3 | Low severity. Medium-severity finding requiring design or config changes. |
| Backlog | Architectural refactoring with no quick remediation path; low immediate exploitability. |

## Shared Report Fragments

Referenced by name from the mode structures below — insert the fragment
verbatim at the referenced point rather than re-deriving the wording. Modes
may append a short mode-specific line on top of a fragment (noted inline
where that happens); the base wording stays the same everywhere it's used.

**Fragment — Needs Review table** (Default/Vendor mode):
{One unified `## Needs Review` section, rendered between Findings and False
Positives (this ordering — Confirmed, then Needs Review, then Rejected —
applies in every mode that has a Needs Review concept). It has up to three
parts; omit any part entirely if it has no rows. Every finding rendered here
has `report_tier: NEEDS_REVIEW` in `phase5-validated.json` (or, in the
`--skip validation` fallback with no validated verdicts at all, this whole
section is empty and omitted — see Deduplication Step above).}

> Findings that are real (or plausible) but not a clean confirm or reject —
> either the evidence needed to resolve them lives outside this repo, or a
> gate suppressed the default verdict for a documented reason. Each reason is
> stated so a reader can decide whether to chase it down.

*Part A — general Needs Review table* (`validation_status` ∈
`NEEDS_EXTERNAL_VERIFICATION`, `PENDING_CROSS_REPO_VALIDATION`, `NEEDS_RUNTIME`
— either because `--runtime` wasn't set, dynamic verification ran but stayed
inconclusive, or a clean dynamic result disagreed with an earlier static
`CONFIRMED`/`CONFIRMED_LOW_CONFIDENCE` and downgraded it here for a human to
reconcile — see `phase5-validate-and-poc.md` → Runtime Value Assessment →
Verdict mutation):

| ID | Type | File | Verdict | Reason |
|----|------|------|---------|--------|
| A-009 | Missing redaction | src/logging/http.ts:L12 | NEEDS_EXTERNAL_VERIFICATION | Depends on an internal package's own redaction behavior — package source not in this repo |
| A-011 | Trust boundary | src/services/internal-client.ts:L8 | PENDING_CROSS_REPO_VALIDATION | Requires cross-repo/topology context — see system-report.md |

*Part B — Non-Production Surface Findings* (`validation_status: SURFACE_NOT_PRODUCTION`):

> Vulnerabilities confirmed in code but located in non-production surfaces (test fixtures, example applications, demo code). Not exploitable from a standard deployed instance, but real code defects. If this code is ever executed in a production context — a CI/CD pipeline with live credentials, a deployed demo environment — these become immediately exploitable.

| ID | Type | File | Surface | Risk if Deployed |
|----|------|------|---------|-----------------|
| O-007 | SQLi | test/helpers/db_test.go:L45 | test (high confidence) | CI pipeline with live DB credentials would expose the injection |

(Vendor mode uses its own adopter-framed variant of this part — see Vendor Report Structure.)

*Part C — Post-Auth Code Vulnerabilities* (`validation_status: BOUNDARY_NOT_CROSSED`,
only occurs when `--verify-deployment` confirmed the deployment is gated —
`deployment-verification.json → classification: gated`):

> Vulnerabilities confirmed in code but not reachable by unauthenticated actors per Phase 2 boundary analysis. Real code defects — excluded from the main findings list because a live check of the deployment (`--verify-deployment`) found it sits behind a verified auth gate. If that auth gate is ever bypassed, these become immediately exploitable.

| ID | Type | File | Auth Gate | Action |
|----|------|------|-----------|--------|
| O-005 | SQLi | api/admin/search.ts:L34 | `authMiddleware + requireAdminRole` (high confidence) | Fix proactively — one auth bypass away from critical |

**Fragment — False Positives table:**
Investigated and ruled out:

| ID | Type | File | Reason |
|----|------|------|--------|
| O-003 | XSS | templates/user.html | Output encoded by Jinja2 autoescape globally |

(Vendor mode prepends "— included so the assessment's rigor is visible" to the
lead-in line and, if the table would be empty, writes "None — no candidate
findings were excluded during validation" instead of an empty table.)

## Findings

{Findings from all phases with `report_tier: CONFIRMED` (deduped per the
Deduplication Step), sorted by Priority then severity. Use a flat numbered
list — no sub-sections by phase. Findings with `report_tier: NEEDS_REVIEW` or
`REJECTED` do not appear here — see Needs Review / False Positives below.}

**Finding IDs — use the original phase-assigned ID, never renumber to F-NN:**

| Source | ID prefix | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Phase 1 · Secret scanning | `S-` | `S-001` |
| Phase 2 · Architecture | `A-` | `A-001` |
| Phase 3 · Dependency CVEs | `C-` | `C-001` |
| Phase 4 · OWASP code analysis | `O-` | `O-001` |
| Phase 4b · LLM/AI security | `L-` | `L-001` |
| PR Review mode · diff-scoped findings | `D-` | `D-001` |

The ID comes directly from the phase JSON file that produced the finding. For Phase 5
validated findings, use `original_id` from `phase5-validated.json` — this is the Phase 4
`O-XXX` id for `source_phase: 4` records, the Phase 2 `A-XXX` id for `source_phase: 2`
records (see Step 0.5 in `phase5-validate-and-poc.md`), or `pr-validated.json`'s
`original_id` — the PR mode `D-XXX` id — when `--pr` was used. Never assign a new
sequential `F-NN` identifier.

**When a finding was confirmed by more than one phase** (e.g. an architecture weakness
also caught as an OWASP code finding): use the canonical ID (Phase 4's `O-XXX` wins
over Phase 2's `A-XXX` per the Deduplication Step above). In the **Description** field
add one sentence: _"Also identified as A-XXX in architectural analysis."_ Do not add a
separate `**Also identified as**` label — fold it into the description prose.

### 🟠 {ID} · {Title}
- **Priority**: P{N}
- **Category**: {e.g. Session Management / Missing Control / Dependency CVE / CI/CD / OWASP A07}
- **File**: `{primary_file}:{line}`
{If code snippet is available:}
**Vulnerable Code**:
```{language}
{snippet — keep to ≤10 lines}
```
- **Description**: {what the problem is and why it matters — include key architectural
  context if this was a merged arch+code finding, without labeling it as such. If a
  secondary phase also identified this finding, end with: "Also identified as {ID} in
  {phase name} analysis."}
- **Impact**: {what an attacker can do}
- **Remediation**: {specific, actionable fix}
{If PoC file exists for this finding:}
- **PoC**: `pocs/{poc_filename}`
{If phase5-validated.json → poc_skipped: true AND finding is CONFIRMED:}
- **PoC**: not generated (pass `--poc` to generate PoC scripts for confirmed findings)

{If runtime_status == RUNTIME_CONFIRMED:}
> ✅ **Runtime Validated** — confirmed against a live Docker instance{, via a headless browser check if the finding is XSS/CSRF/clickjacking}.
{If runtime_verdict_change is not null:}
> ℹ️ Dynamic verification changed this finding's status: {runtime_verdict_change.from} → {runtime_verdict_change.to} ({runtime_verdict_change.reason}).
{If evidence notes a security_posture cross-check ("confirmed live" — Phase 5 Step 3):}
> ✅ **Confirmed live** — the deployment's actual cookie/TLS configuration matches this finding (`--verify-deployment`), independent of Docker/`--runtime`.

## Vendor Report Structure (`--vendor`)

Produced instead of the default structure when `--vendor` is set. Read
`phase2-architecture.json → project_overview` for the "What This Tool Does"
section, and the confirmed findings from `phase4-owasp.json` / `phase5-validated.json`
(and `phase-llm-security.json` if present). Secrets and CVE inputs are absent
(force-skipped) — do not fabricate those sections.

### Verdict rubric (compute before rendering)

Derive **overall risk** from the worst *confirmed* finding, weighted by
reachability and by whether the adopter can mitigate it without vendor changes:

| Overall risk | When |
|---|---|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | A confirmed CRITICAL finding on an attacker-reachable path (RCE, auth bypass, deserialization-to-RCE, hardcoded backdoor), **or** evidence of intentional malice / data exfiltration / obfuscated payloads / hostile install-time scripts. |
| 🟠 HIGH | Confirmed HIGH finding(s) that are exploitable, with no clean adopter-side mitigation. |
| 🟡 MODERATE | Real findings (medium, or high but fully containable by deployment controls the adopter owns). |
| 🟢 LOW | Only low-severity / informational findings; no exploitable trust-boundary issue found in what was reviewed. |

Map to the **verdict**:
- **DO NOT ADOPT** — a confirmed CRITICAL/HIGH finding that is reachable **and**
  has `Mitigation available to us: none — requires a vendor code change`; or any
  intentional-malice signal. State the single deciding finding plainly.
- **ADOPT WITH CONDITIONS** — real findings exist but are containable by
  controls the adopting team applies itself. The **Conditions** list is then
  mandatory and each condition must map to a specific finding.
- **ADOPT** — only low-severity issues (or none) in the reviewed scope. Note
  standard hygiene and the scope limits so a clean result is not over-read.

Ground every driver in a confirmed finding or an explicit `project_overview`
signal (e.g. `has_shell_execution`, `has_external_http_calls`) — never speculate.

**Conditions for safe internal use:**
{Mandatory when verdict is ADOPT WITH CONDITIONS (each condition maps to a finding);
for ADOPT, list recommended hardening; for DO NOT ADOPT, list what would have to
change to reconsider. Controls the adopter can apply WITHOUT vendor changes.}
- {e.g. Run network-isolated — the tool makes outbound calls to `{host}` (A-002).}
- {e.g. Never pass production credentials or secrets to it (O-004).}
- {e.g. Pin to reviewed commit `{sha}`; re-run this review on upgrade.}

**Key risk drivers:**
- {highest-severity confirmed findings, one line each — the findings that set the verdict}

## Scope & Limitations

- **Not run in vendor mode**: secret scanning (Phase 1), dependency/CVE scanning
  (Phase 3), and PoC generation. If the security team also needs a CVE/dependency
  view of this vendor, re-run without `--vendor`.
- **No whole-program taint analysis.** Detection is static + rule-based (Semgrep)
  plus per-file LLM reasoning; cross-file data flows may be missed. A clean result
  means "no rule-matched or hand-traced sink," not "no issue exists."
- **Detection-gated checks.** {Read `phase4-owasp.json` checks_skipped and
  `tech-stack.json → detection`; name any class not tested and any check that ran
  at reduced confidence. "Skipped" is not evidence of absence.}
- **File coverage.** {Read `phase2-architecture.json → coverage`. If `not_read`
  is non-empty or any `coverage.directories` entry has `read: 0`, name what was
  not fully read and why — an un-read directory is a broader gap than one file.}
- **Model**: `{standard_tier_model}` (vendor mode pins all phases to the
  resolved Standard tier model — never Opus).

## PR Review Report Structure (`--pr`)

Produced instead of the default/vendor structure when `--pr` is set.
Read `pr-findings.json` and `pr-validated.json` (substituted filenames per
`phase5-validate-and-poc.md`'s "PR Review Mode substitution" note). Do not read or reference
`phase1-secrets.json` / `phase2-architecture.json` / `phase3-cves.json` /
`phase4-owasp.json` / `phase5-validated.json` — those belong to the full-scan
pipeline and are not produced by this mode.

# PR Security Review

**Review Date**: {date}
**Model**: {standard_tier_model} (PR mode pins to the resolved Standard tier — never Opus)

## Summary

{1-2 sentences: what this PR does from a security lens, and the headline
risk if any CRITICAL/HIGH findings exist.}

| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| 🔴 Critical | N |
| 🟠 High | N |
| 🟡 Medium | N |
| 🟢 Low | N |

{All four rows above always render, even when N is 0 — never omit a
zero-count row. This is an instruction to you; no footnote or note about it
appears in the actual report.}

{If any CRITICAL/HIGH findings exist:}
**Recommendation**: 🚫 Do not merge until addressed — {one-line reason naming the finding(s)}.
{Otherwise:}
**Recommendation**: ✅ No blocking findings in this diff.

---

## Removed Security Controls          ← omit entirely if no finding has regression: true

{Findings with `regression: true` — a control that existed before this diff
and does not anymore. Render first and separately from other findings; this
class of issue is often more urgent than a net-new vulnerability because it's
a regression in previously-working protection, not a gap that was always there.}

### 🔴 {ID} · {Title}
- **Severity**: {severity}
- **File**: `{file}:{line}`
- **Removed** (was at pre-diff line {removed_control.pre_diff_line}):
```{language}
{removed_control.pre_diff_code}
```
- **What changed**: {description — what the control did and why its removal matters}
- **Impact**: {attack_vector}
- **Validation**: {CONFIRMED — no equivalent control found elsewhere in the call chain | CONFIRMED_LOW_CONFIDENCE — reason}
- **Fix**: {remediation — usually "restore the removed check" unless it was deliberately consolidated elsewhere}

---

## Findings                          ← new vulnerable code introduced by this diff

{Findings with `regression: false`, sorted by severity — highest first. Flat
list, no priority labels. Use the `D-` prefix from pr-findings.json/
pr-validated.json — never renumber to F-NN.}

### 🟠 {ID} · {Title}
- **Severity**: {severity}
- **Category**: {OWASP A0x / API / secret / dependency CVE}
- **File**: `{file}:{line}`
{If code snippet available (≤10 lines):}
**Code**:
```{language}
{snippet}
```
- **Description**: {what the problem is and why it matters}
- **Impact**: {what an attacker can do}
- **Auth context**: {if this finding's route appears in touched_auth_context: "Route is {auth_status} ({auth_confidence} confidence) — {basis}"; omit this line entirely for non-route findings}
- **Remediation**: {specific, actionable fix}

{If no non-regression findings exist:}
_No new vulnerabilities introduced by this diff._

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use severity emoji consistently: 🔴 Critical, 🟠 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low
- Every finding must have a remediation — never "this is bad" without "do this"
- False Positives section is mandatory in default/vendor modes — it
  builds trust with the dev team. PR Review mode (`--pr`) has no False
  Positives section — see PR Review Report Structure.
- Needs Review section is conditional in default/vendor modes — omit the
  whole heading when no finding has `report_tier: NEEDS_REVIEW`, don't render
  it empty. PR Review mode has no Needs Review section either (Step 0.5,
  which is what produces `NEEDS_EXTERNAL_VERIFICATION`/`PENDING_CROSS_REPO_VALIDATION`
  findings, does not run in PR mode).
- PoC scripts are referenced by filename only —
  `- **PoC**: \`pocs/{poc_filename}\`` — never inline code blocks
- Redact ALL secret values — show only first 4 and last 3 chars
- Finding headers show a single severity (effective value only)
- **Output sanitization (mandatory)**: All strings sourced from the target
  repository — file names, variable names, config values, finding titles, code
  snippets, commit messages — are untrusted. Before embedding them in Markdown:
  - Escape backtick runs by using a longer fence (e.g. use ```` ``` ```` or
    ```` ```` ```` if the snippet itself contains three backticks)
  - Escape `#` at the start of a line inside prose to prevent heading injection
  - Escape `[` and `]` in non-code contexts to prevent link injection
  - Render all repo-sourced strings as code spans or fenced blocks, never as
    bare prose that could be interpreted as Markdown structure

## Final Response (chat output)

Your own closing message — separate from the orchestrator's progress line and
its later post-report recap (SKILL.md → Final Step, which reads the finished
report back off disk) — is a channel that can leak the full report into the
chat if you're not careful. Do not paste the report content, individual
findings, or a narrative summary in your final response. Everything belongs
in `final-report.md` (or `pr-report.md` in PR mode). Your final message is the
one line below, nothing else.

## Delivery

```bash
echo "✅ Phase 6 complete — report written to {repo_path}/.security-review/final-report.md"
# PR Review mode (--pr): echo the pr-report.md path instead — see Output Path exception above.
```

Do not copy to `--output`, do not call `present_files`. The orchestrator performs those steps.
